						Compost is one way of growing the nutrient profile of a soil or soil-less mix. It’s natural, and requires very little effort on the part of the gardener. Here’s my take on compost, how to make it, and the power it has in growing healthy plants. Hot composting seems like the standard example. Simply pile in carbon-rich materials with nitrogen-rich materials (like sawdust and grass clipping, respectively), in roughly the ratio of 30:1 carbon to nitrogen, and make a pile at least 3 feet wide and 3 feet deep (one cubic yard). As microbes digest the pile, it will heat up and kill pathogens and any seeds that made it into the pile.<br>

						The end result is “compost” and is carried out on both large and small scale by mushroom farms, municipal compost facilities, and operations of all sizes. Many nutrients that were in the base material end up making it into the finished product, less some nitrogen and carbon that were released back into the atmosphere, whence they came. Hot compost is also full of microbes, both living and dead – that’s a good thing.
					
					</p>
					<p>
						So far we know that compost has both nutrients and micro-organisms. Plants evolved to flourish when these are present. 
						<br>
						Compost also carries with it a high level of carbon, the same stuff in greenhouse gas, but in the form of organic matter. Organic matter is a very broad category that can include semi-broken down plant material, decaying microbes and small insects, and up to fully-formed humus.
						<br>
						Humus is the final stage of organic matter – a state where no further decomposition will occur. Home gardeners and nurseries often purchase “potting mix” - the main ingredient is usually sphagnum peat moss. Peat can be considered humus. It’s VERY decomposed. You can’t tell what plants went into the peat bog, and microbes can’t break it down any further. It’s fluffy, it holds water well, holds onto nutrients very well, and it’s very carbon-rich. So rich that many households burn peat as a heat source. Generally, anything that is combusted as fuel is carbon-rich (gasoline, methane, ethanol, wood). That carbon in peat, it was transformed from gas to solid plants 12,000 years ago.
					
						<br>	
						In any event, the banana that now sits in your fruit basket is a big store of atmospheric carbon, and that carbon will eventually be stored long-term in the soil, be released back into the atmosphere by fermentation, or be used in your own body as fuel. If you toss it into your compost pile, the sugary carbon will be decomposed by tiny insects, microbes, and worms. The soil food web will be boosted by that very banana.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now we know that compost has nutrients, micro-organisms, and is carbon rich. These are the makings of great soil.
						<br>
						Plants are simple things, but form complex relationships with micro-organisms. Just like your gut-bacteria help you absorb nutrients from your food – soil-microbes form mutually-beneficial relationships with plants. These microbes decompose organic matter and, as a natural part of their existence, produce plant nutrients as a byproduct.
						<br>
						For example, that banana you toss into the compost has high levels of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, and so on. Microbes use those elements to build themselves. When they die, or are eaten by other microbes, some of the elements are released  as plant nutrients. It’s nature’s version of a “slow release fertilizer”. All the while, these microbes fix carbon into a stable form.
						<br>
						This is why plants flourish with compost. It’s the fertilizer they evolved to use.
						<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						Hot compost is only one way that we harness this process. My favorite alternative is vermicompost, when worms digest food in the soil and excrete worm castings – which are intensely rich in microbes, nutrients, and have excellent structural properties.
						<br>
						Aged manure from cows and other ruminants is also very usable. Vermicompost, though, really is the best.
						<br>
						Cold compost occurs when organic matter doesn’t meet the volume requirements necessary to build up heat and decomposition momentum. It’s a slower process, and occurs naturally when a fallen tree decomposes in the forest, or when an apple drops uneaten from the tree and breaks down over weeks or months. The lack of high temperature allows many soil microbes, small insects and animals, and worms to come into the process early on.
						<br>
						I like to expose hot compost to the elements for a season before use. It gets rained on and plants begin growing. Ants come, fungus and mold grows, small rodents pick it through. Once nature uses the compost for a year – it’s REALLY alive. A scoop of that compost shows many varieties of insects, worms, and creatures not visible by the unaided eye. Not to mention an endless network of fungal structures. Plant roots desire that kind of environment, if they could desire.
						<br>
						Cold compost also occurs when organic gardeners perform “top dressing” of organic fertilizer sources, like alfalfa meal or peanut meal, dispersing the material loosely on the soil surface, or working it into the top layer of soil.
					</p>
					<p>
						The forms of compost already mentioned are aerobic processes, which means they use oxygen to work. Some forms of composting are anaerobic, and utilize certain microbes such as lactobacillus – which is how sour beer is made, and how buttermilk is made. You can find anaerobic composting methods used in Korean Natural Farming and some fertilizer-intended fermentations.
						<br>
						Leaf mold compost is a slow process by which the carbon-rich / nitrogen lacking leaf cover is gathered up and left to decompose for years until fungal growth consumes the organic matter. Fungus is a powerful force in the soil. Fungus is capable of fetching hard-to-reach nutrients in the soil and bringing it to the plant roots. The relationship between fungus and plant roots can be described as intelligent, once you understand the details.
						<br>

					<p>
						[Heading – Super Compost]
						Premium, super-charged, amazing compost. That’s what I’m after. The kind that grows bulletproof plants. Nutrient dense. Super healthy.
						As a soil-geek, I try and make the most premium compost I can. Here’s the recipe:
						<br>
							<ui>
									<li>5 gallons spent mushroom soil.</li>
									<li>2 cups pulverized limestone</li>
									<li>1 cup calcium bentonite</li>
									<li>1 cup gypsum</li>
									<li>1 cup kelp meal</li>
									<li>3 cups barley malt flour</li>
									<li>1 tsp epsom salt</li>
									<li>2 gallons perlite</li>
							</ui>

					</p>
					<p>
						mix these ingredients together uniformly and make sure it’s about as moist as a wrung-out sponge. You can shovel the mix into a fabric pot or simple pile it somewhere that’s not too cold (say, below 50 F). In a few days the mix should be hot. Even at the scale listed in the recipe, the mix WILL be noticeably warm. Usually I multiply the batch by 10 or 20, depending on how much material I have to work through.
						<br>
						After a few weeks the compost should cool down. At that point, I just leave it outside to get rained on and for life to discover and begin to utilize it. Initially, it will be too strong for plants to grow in directly. It’s too rich in nutrients. Rain helps wash out the excesses, and microbes help pack away the nutrients into the slow-release forms. Worms will find the pile and begin to digest it further. Sounding premium yet? I think so.
						<br>
						Keep the compost aerated and moist. You might have to water the pile and turn it by hand, to keep adequate moisture and to introduce oxygen, respectively.
						<br>
						After one year of aging outside, the compost will be rich and fluffy, like chocolate cake. Larger pieces in the spent mushroom substrate will have been broken down into something that resembles peat moss. But it’s much, much better than peat.
						<br>
						If you’re a geek like me, send off a sample of the compost for analysis and see what the nutrient levels are like. Or not. Nature is on your side here, and plants will mostly do well if you spread some of this compost around. Why? Because the compost is rich in plant nutrients, microbes, and organic matter.
					</p>
					<p>
						Changing the recipe.
						<br>
						Notice that my recipe uses spent mushroom substrate (SMS) as the base. It’s cheap and readily available in the Northeast of the USA. It’s left over after mushroom growers are done using it. By itself, it’s a very good topdressing material for gardens. But it’s not balanced. Too high in potassium, compared to calcium and phosphorus. The source material for the SMS is straw, manure, and amendments like limestone. We can make it better.
						<br>
						If you have a different compost that’s readily available near you, then use it. If you don’t have cheap piles of brown material at landscape supply yards near you, then get some peat moss or coco coir. Both will serve as the base for a good premium compost. You can also use plain old dirt as the base. Dirt has been in compost for billions of years. The best kind is not pure clay or pure sand, but somewhere in between.
						<br>
						As for the limestone, calcium bentonite, and gypsum in my recipe. Feel free to replace any of those with ground up rocks. Most any person in the USA will at least have access to pulverized (powdered) limestone for around $5 per 30 lb at big box stores. If you want, replace all the ground up rock with simple pulverized garden lime – often called “Ag Lime”. Many compost-makers like to use azomite, ground basalt rock, or other ground rocks. You should read about them if you’re curious. Calcium, however, is what we want from pulverized limestone. That’s what I’m after.
						<br>
						For the malted barley flour and kelp meal. Feel free to substitute any plant meals. Peanut meal, alfalfa meal, cottonseed meal, or any bi-product of food processing that in a relatively unrefined form will work. Use about the same quantities as this recipe.
						<br>
						A note on malted grains. Barley malt flour contains sugars, nutrients, and enzymes that are used to brew beer. Fermentation of beer is a microbial process, so it’s no wonder that malted grain is excellent in compost. The fungal growth that comes from malted grains is powerful. But it’s expensive. $40 for 50 pounds. Alfalfa meal can be had much cheaper, but lacks the enzymes found in malt.
						<br>
						Aeration. Perlite is used in this compost to increase air holding capacity and to prevent anaerobic pockets and compaction. It’s a low-weight, puffy white rock that’s produced by heating rocks until steam puffs the rock up. It’s great for helping heavy compost and soil retain air. It’s best quality? It’s cheap. And it works.
						<br>
						Pumice is the natural version of perlite – it forms during volcanic activity and is much heavier and usually much more expensive than perlite. Unless you live by where pumice is mined, it’s probably cheaper to use perlite for aeration.
						<br>
						For a truly interesting compost, you can use rice hulls in place of perlite for aeration. You can find these online under “parboiled rice hulls” and at the homebrew store. Brewers use them to aid in flow during the beer making process. They function much the same way in soil. Expect to pay $35 for 50 lbs of compressed rice hulls at the homebrew store – which is about 52 gallons, loose.
						<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						Looking at the recipe again, epsom salt is a source of magnesium. Another is dolomite lime – very similar to the pulverized limestone already mentioned, but it has a higher amount of magnesium. Both dolomite and regular limestone have a high proportion of magnesium. The proportion of calcium to magnesium in the compost should be 5 to 1, so they say. You can leave it out of your compost and still achieve good quality.
						<br>
						The recipe for most geek-level compost looks like this:<ui>
							<li>1 part base material (like coco coir, peat, SMS, dirt, or leaf mold compost)</li>
							<li>1/3 part aeration like perlite, rice hulls, or pumice</li>
							<li>3-4 cups (per 5 gallons) ground rock like limestone or basalt</li>
							<li>4 cups (per 5 gallons) plant based amendments like alfalfa meal or barley meal</li></ui>
						<br>
						A soil test will tell you which plant nutrients are lacking. There are 23 recognized plant nutrients. The balancing part of making good compost… that’s a science in it’s own right.
